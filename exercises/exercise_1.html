        <h1>The State of the World</h1>
        <p>This world has made advances in technology that allow one to speak face to face with those they never would have met otherwise. Or to display one's art for the world to see even if they do not look. Advances in medicine have saved my life as well as the lives of those around me many times over. However...all is not perfect.</p>

        <p>This world has become greedy, turning into a second Dark Ages slowly and we recognise it but can do nothing about it as power is gradually stripped away from the people. Love and let love is not a thing that all believe in but what can be done to help tolerate things like this and get power back to the people?</p>

        <p>I would like to issue a Speak Not, Write Not act somewhere in the U.S. banning the public recruitment of religious groups and preventing the newspaper from pubishing articles that are not paid for by local peoples. Prevention of aggression is key to eliminating it, this does not take away the practice of worship but instead hides them from those that would seek to harm the followers of that particular religon. The newspaper should be given back to the local people and word of mouth should dictate what ends up in the press not government dollars. Freedom of the press is not freedom if it is all paid for propaganda by the government.</p>
