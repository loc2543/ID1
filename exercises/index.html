        <p>In this class, I hope to learn the skills I need for coding without getting lost in technical jargan. Last I took this class, it was with a teacher (not naming names) who did not know how to cater to visual learners. Which one would think would be obvious as this is a <b>visual</b> art academy. Let's get on this rollercoaster of the same name and hope for a better rider.</p>
        <p>Here's a list of the exercises and projects that I have completed in this class:</p>
