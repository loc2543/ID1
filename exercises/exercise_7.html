        <h1>Exercise 7: Website Analysis</h1>
        <h2>96 Elephants</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The adjectives that I would use to describe the design of this website are: heavy, dark, and bold.</li>
            <li>The navigation is shown through numbered chapters with bold, bright read titles that easily flow in order from one to the next.
            </li>
            <li>Chapter three lists a call to action rather than the link to another chapter of information.</li>
            <li>This site is not only meant to inform the viewer about the loss of elephants but also hopes to involve them in the conservation effort.</li>
        </ol>
