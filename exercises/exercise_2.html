            <!--Question 1-->
            <li><strong>Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
            <p>There are no headers but the text in the body brings to mind old parchment or ink well writing. The Gothic text is classic for those who like the look and feel of old style writing rather than bland Helvetica.</p>
            <!--Question 2-->
            <li><strong>Describe the color palette. What colors are used? Where and how are specific colors used?</strong></li>
            <p>Amongst the white and black there are hints of purple to bring a splash of color every now and then. The white background with black text is simple and easy to read while the purple is used to highlight important details.</p>
            <!--Question 3-->
            <li><strong>What role do the visuals play? When and how are visuals used?</strong></li>
            <p>Other than establishing the duo's appearance I cant see exactly what purpose they play. There's nothing but portraits of these two and even then it feels like the same portrait used over and over.</p>
            <!--Question 4-->
            <li><strong>How are sections separated? What are the visual cues?</strong></li>
            <p>Mainly the photos of the lead member of the group seperate each section but I felt that this is very repetative and not very creative at all. Other than the photo, there is very little to signal the shift.</p>
