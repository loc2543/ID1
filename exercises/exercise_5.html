                    <li><strong>What adjectives would you use to describe Bethany's Portfolio?</strong>"Sparing" and "Unenthusiastic" would be the words that I used. Sure there are some bright colors but there is...nothing here that grabs my intrest other than the "in your face" heading.</li>
                    <li><strong>What pages are on Bethany's Portfolio?</strong>About, Work, and Musings are the tabs that I can see straight away in the navigation bar. About is the home page for the designer, Work show us some of what she has created both in coding and in her digital artwork. Musings however shows us some of her artwork of other kinds, like typography and photography.</li>
                    <li><strong>What have you learned about Bethany?</strong>She has worked in several buisness groups for print design and her favorite thing to photograph is an old hat. I can see why, it has a lot of texture in it that shows up nicely in photography.</li>
                    <li><strong>Describe the design and layout of the body content.</strong>Clean serif and sans-serif type for easy reading. But on the desktop some of the text is extremely small and difficult to read for those of us with glasses.</li>
                    <li><strong>What information does Bethany place into the footer?</strong>An easy little instant email thing that seems to be for contacting her. Rather than contact information she has given us a way to contact her directly.</li>
                </ol>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>How does the navigation change?</strong>The navigation is placed into a drop down menu to make it easier and simple to navigate while also keping the main page clear.</li>
                    <li><strong>How does the size of the headline text change?</strong>It shrinks to fit the screen better and that is all that I can really see as far as differences go.</li>
                    <li><strong>How does the size of the body text change?</strong>It doesn't really but maybe on a smaller screen it would seem bigger than it is, for me it's still very small.</li>
                    <li><strong>How does the layout of the content change?</strong>The sections stack under eachother neatly and are easy to follow without moving the screen too much.</li>
                    <li><strong>How does the layout of the footer change?</strong>The footer is now stacked under the sections and is and is pale compared to the rest of the page.</li>

                    <li><strong>What adjectives would you use to describe Olivia's portfolio?</strong> "Classy" is the best one that I can think of as it reads more like a beauty magizine in my mind. Very few words and more pictures cover the screen.</li>
                    <li><strong>Describe the layout and design of the introductory section.</strong>There is very little information but she tells us about her time in London and what system she is most comfortable with using.</li>
                    <li><strong>Describe the layout and design of the portfolio entries.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Describe the layout and design of the footer</strong></li>

                    <li><strong>How does the layout of the introductory section change?</strong>The large photograph is removed and has now been filled with the text of the introduction.</li>
                    <li><strong>How does the layout of the portfolio entries change?</strong>The changes of the background colors indicate the changes in projects. Which is very handy to keep things organised if you are swiftly looking for something on the page.</li>
