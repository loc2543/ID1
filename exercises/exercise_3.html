            <!--Question 1-->
            <li><strong>Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
            <p>There are no headers here but the pull quotes and the first letter of each paragraph is written in a font that mimics hand writing. Very painterly handwriting but still hand writing none the less. Thick black strokes with some frayed edges and peices missing in the middle of some strokes.</p>
            <!--Question 2-->
            <li><strong>Describe the color palette. What colors are used? Where and how are specific colors used?</strong></li>
            <p>The color pallete is mostly made up of cool relaxing colors and are heavily seen in the backdrop of the drop quotes or used in the images rather than in the main body of the website.</p>
            <!--Question 3-->
            <li><strong>What role do the visuals play? When and how are visuals used?</strong></li>
            <p>The visuals acompany some of the pull quotes but are also used to mark new sections when each few sets of paragraphs are made. The visuals are calm but mostly establish that this is the artist himself that we are looking at.</p>
            <!--Question 4-->
            <li><strong>How are sections separated? What are the visual cues?</strong></li>
            <p>Other than the photographs/gifs, each section is marked by a capital letter set in a very different font compared tot the serif Roman font that is used in the paragraphs.</p>
