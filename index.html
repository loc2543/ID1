        <p>In this class, I hope to learn the skills I need for coding without getting lost in technical vocabulary. Last I took this class, it was with a teacher (not naming names) who did not know how to cater to visual learners. Which one would think would be obvious as this is a <b>visual</b> art academy. Let's get on this rollercoaster of the same name and hope for a better ride.</p>

        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p><b>Tell me about your path to becoming a designer.</b>I've been drawing and writing for as long as I can remember however I didn't consider it as a valid path for me until my last year in middle school. I then went to a high school for the arts and graduated dual strand Theater and Visual Art. I went to East Tennessee University where I got a start an introduction to animation but the required classes there had an unenthusiastic faculty. Thus I returned to Virgina and enrolled at Tidwater Community College to continue my art studies. You could say I did it out of spite at first, just to prove my old classmates wrong. However, I have come to love what I do in time and I enjoy my ad designs and my own sketch time at home.</p>
        <p><b>Tell me about your aspirations as a designer. What do you hope to do as a designer?</b> My main dream is to one day further my eduation enough to become a storyboard artist for cartoons or at least create the ads for movies, cartoons, and video games. No point being grown up if you can't be allowed to act childish every now and then.</p>
