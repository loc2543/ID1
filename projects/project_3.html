            <h2>Skyward Sword</h2> 
            <p>Skyward Sword is the first in the timeline of the Legend of Zelda series, and establishes the origins of the master sword and the reasons behind the trio of main characters to clash together again and again every few centuries or so.</p>
            <p>According to this game’s legend, three ancient Goddesses created the Triforce: a power capable of granting any wish. A Demon King named Demise desired the Triforce, and destroyed the land in his quest for it. The Goddess Hylia gathered the remaining people on a giant outcrop of rock and sent it into the sky beyond the clouds, allowing her to launch a full-scale offensive against Demise allied with the land's remaining benevolent races. She was victorious, but the land was severely damaged. Uncounted years later, the outcrop is known under the name of Skyloft, and its people believe the "Surface" below the clouds is a myth.</p>
            <p>This incarnation of Link reveals himself to be the hero of legend when he pulls the Goddess Sword out of the pedestal at the base of his home island’s Goddess Statue. Zelda, his best friend, tells him that she is the mortal reincarnation of Hylia, who could not kill Demise but chose Link while as a mortal to wield the Triforce in her place. Upon his defeat, Demise places a curse upon Link and Zelda that their descendants would be haunted by Demise’s own reincarnated rage.</p> 
            <p>The game ends with Zelda deciding to remain on the Surface to watch over the Triforce: she and Link together establish the kingdom of Hyrule.</p>
