            <h2>Skyward Sword</h2> 
            <p>Skyward Sword is the first in the timeline of the Legend of Zelda series, and establishes the origins of the master sword and the reasons behind the trio of main characters to clash together again and again every few centuries or so.</p>
            <p>According to this game’s legend, three ancient Goddesses created the Triforce: a power capable of granting any wish. A Demon King named Demise desired the Triforce, and destroyed the land in his quest for it. The Goddess Hylia gathered the remaining people on a giant outcrop of rock and sent it into the sky beyond the clouds, allowing her to launch a full-scale offensive against Demise allied with the land's remaining benevolent races. She was victorious, but the land was severely damaged. Uncounted years later, the outcrop is known under the name of Skyloft, and its people believe the "Surface" below the clouds is a myth.</p>
            <p>This incarnation of Link reveals himself to be the hero of legend when he pulls the Goddess Sword out of the pedestal at the base of his home island’s Goddess Statue. Zelda, his best friend, tells him that she is the mortal reincarnation of Hylia, who could not kill Demise but chose Link while as a mortal to wield the Triforce in her place. Upon his defeat, Demise places a curse upon Link and Zelda that their descendants would be haunted by Demise’s own reincarnated rage.</p> 
            <p>The game ends with Zelda deciding to remain on the Surface to watch over the Triforce: she and Link together establish the kingdom of Hyrule.</p>

            <h2>The Minish Cap</h2>
            <p>Many centuires later...</p>
            <p>The Legend of this current realm: Evil spirits appeared in the kingdom of Hyrule and to protect the land, the tiny Picori descended from the skies and chose to give a human a shining golden light and a single sword. This hero used his wisdom and courage, his golden power, and his sword to fight off the demons and restore peace to the world.</p>
            <p>The people grateful to the Picori so they held an annual celebration in their honor. Whoever won the sword competition during the festival would earn the honor of touching the sacred blade. The tradition of the Picori Festival continued, but over the generations, the Picori themselves passed into legend. The legend of the Picori tells of a doorway that opens just once every hundred years. When the door is open, the Picori can cross from their world into Hyrule.</p>
            <p>One year, in celebration of when the Picori last came to Hyrule 100 years ago to the day, the festival was unusually grand. Hyrule Castle was hosting a tournament of sword-fighting skill that calls to mind the heroes of legend. That year’s champion was a mysterious man by the name of Vaati. He won the tournament with an almost magical ease, and all of Hyrule was abuzz with rumors about this shadowy figure. The young Link, who attended the festival that year with his childhood friend, Princess Zelda, was charged by his grandfather, Smith, with delivering a sword that would be presented to the champion.
            <p>During the ceremony following the sword competition, Vaati shattered the sacred Picori Blade and opened the Bound Chest, which, for an age, had been sealed by the Picori Blade, trapping evil monsters within. Vaati was after the Light Force, that golden light that was once wielded by the hero mentioned in the legends of the Picori. He subdued the castle guards and turned Princess Zelda to stone before making a speedy departure. Vaati was a Minish, an apprentice of Ezlo, who was also a Minish. Ezlo had made a magical cap with the power to grant wishes, but Vaati had stolen it and used it to become a powerful sorcerer. He had transformed Ezlo into a hat himself, then proceeded to hunt down the Light Force. Link was then asked by King Daltus to seek out the Picori and ask them to reforge the sacred blade, and traveled to the Minish Woods with the help of his Map. There he met Ezlo, a curious creature who he rescued from a group of monsters. Ezlo hopped on his head and offered to help him find the Picori. He also helped Link shrink down to a minuscule size — the size of the Picori people, who called themselves the Minish. Link met with the elder of Minish Village, who told him that in order to reforge the sacred Picori sword he would require the four Elements, the embodiments of the sacred powers of earth, fire, water, and wind.</p>
            <p>Once he had gathered the Four Elements, he brought the Picori Blade — renamed the White Sword by a Minish sword-smith — to the Elemental Sanctuary hidden within the courtyard of Hyrule Castle. There he infused the White Sword with the Elements, fully restoring the sacred Four Sword — a legendary blade with the power to split one warrior into four.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Vaati had brainwashed King Daltus and shrouded Hyrule Castle in darkness. He had discovered that the sacred Light Force had actually been passed down through Hyrule’s princesses, and so he prepared to extract the Light Force from Princess Zelda. Link rushed to her rescue, and, after vanquishing Vaati, he used the Four Sword’s evil-banishing power to restore Princess Zelda.</p>
            <p>Now that Vaati had fallen, the Mage's Cap could be used to restore Hyrule. Princess Zelda put on the cap and wished with all her heart that Vaati’s cruelty might be undone. With her righteous wish and the power of the Light Force that still dwells within her, many miracles happened as a result.</p>
            <p>Now that the land of the humans had been saved, Ezlo ventured back into the world of the Minish through the Minish Door, not to return until perhaps the next day, one hundred years later, when the doorway to their world would open once more.</p>
